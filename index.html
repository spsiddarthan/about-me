  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>I'm a Senior Backend Engineer with 11+ years of experience building scalable, reliable systems. Most recently, I was at <a href="https://automattic.com/" target="_blank">Automattic</a>, working on Jetpack — powering features used by millions of WordPress sites. I specialize in distributed systems, scalable architecture, and building robust APIs.</p>
