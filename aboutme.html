  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>I’m a backend engineer with 11+ years of experience building scalable, reliable systems. Most recently, I was at <a href="https://automattic.com/" target="_blank">Automattic</a>, working on Jetpack — powering features used by millions of WordPress sites.</p>

  <p>I live in India and can be reached at <a href="mailto:siddarthan@outlook.com">siddarthan@outlook.com</a>.<br>
     You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/spsiddarthan/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="#your-newsletter-link" target="_blank">my newsletter</a>.</p>

  <p>I care about thoughtful engineering, clear communication, and building software that actually helps people. Whether it’s designing a scalable OAuth token encryption solution or leading product development for Jetpack Social, I enjoy solving complex problems that deliver real value.</p>

  <p>Previously, I’ve worked across startups and growth-stage companies — from CI/CD infrastructure at Shippable, to developer platforms at Hashnode, to internal tools at Radius Agent that saved real dollars. I’ve also stepped into team leadership when needed, conducted 1:1s, and wrote performance reviews.</p>

  <h2>Selected Work Highlights:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Built scalable social sharing infrastructure at Automattic, integrating platforms like LinkedIn, Instagram, and Mastodon.</li>
    <li>Modernized legacy codebases for WordPress plugins, improving developer experience and performance.</li>
    <li>Designed dashboards and wrote complex analytics queries to support data-driven decisions.</li>
    <li>Led integration of cloud services into Shippable’s pipeline, improving dev workflows.</li>
  </ul>
